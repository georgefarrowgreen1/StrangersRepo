# Data model

The diary stores JSON documents at slash-separated paths, Firestore-style: an even number of segments is a document (`days/2026-10-27`), an odd number is a collection (`days`, `sites/cafe/days`).

## Where each site's data lives

| Site | Path prefix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Roastery | *(none: top level)* | `days/2026-10-27` |
| Cafe | `sites/cafe/` | `sites/cafe/days/2026-10-27` |
| ASG | `sites/asg/` | `sites/asg/days/2026-10-27` |
| Factory | `sites/factory/` | `sites/factory/days/2026-10-27` |

The Roastery's records were recorded before sites existed, so they sit at the top level. **Keep it that way:** the page relies on it, and moving them would mean migrating every document.

## Allowed collections

Under each site prefix:

`settings` · `days` · `weeks` · `extras` · `cleaning` · `proveit` · `allergens` · `allergenDocs` · `suppliers` · `contacts` · `staff` · `reviews` · `plans` · `onboarding` · `inspections` · `deliveries` · `maintenance`

Plus two single documents: `config/shared` (the shared setup, below) and `config/people` (read-only: names for people who recorded in the earlier Claude version of the diary, see below).

Reject any other path with `invalid_argument`.

## D1 table

`src/schema.ts` creates it (with the `users`, `secrets`, `meta` and `rate_limits` tables for accounts, sessions, change tracking and rate limiting):

```sql
CREATE TABLE docs (
  path        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- e.g. 'sites/cafe/days/2026-10-27'
  collection  TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. 'sites/cafe/days'
  doc_id      TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. '2026-10-27'
  data        TEXT,                       -- JSON; NULL when deleted
  updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,           -- ms since epoch
  source      TEXT NOT NULL,              -- 'web'; 'claude' on rows copied from the earlier Claude diary
  deleted     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- deletes are kept as rows so live polling sees them
  claude_data TEXT,                       -- unused (left from the Claude sync)
  seq         INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- change counter for live polling
  updated_by  TEXT                        -- 'web:<name>'
);
```

Queries the page makes: one document by path; a whole collection; a collection ordered by one field and limited (`days` by `date` desc, `weeks` by `week` desc, `reviews` by `date` desc, `proveit` by `at` desc). Ordering on a JSON field with `json_extract(data,'$.date')` is fine at this size (hundreds of documents per collection).

## Documents

Timestamps (`at`, `lastAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) are ms since epoch. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings. `by` fields are user ids: `web:<name>` (the signed-in person's display name), or `u_…` on older records made in the Claude version of the diary, whose names are in `config/people`.

**`settings/main`**, one per site: the site's setup.
```
units:[{id,name,kind:"fridge"|"freezer"}]
opening|closing|weekly:[{id,t,off?:true}]     // checks; off = turned off at this site
closedDays:[0..6]   // 0 = Sunday
hide:{<tab>:true}   // sections not used at this site
proveOff:[<method>]  trainingOff:[<topic>]  info:{address,manager,note}  startDate
updatedBy, updatedAt, publishedAt?, publishedFrom?
```

**`days/<YYYY-MM-DD>`**: one diary page.
```
date
temps:{<unitId>:{am:{v,by,at}}}
opening|closing:{items:{<checkId>:bool}, by, at, allDone?:{by,at}}
problems:{text,by,at}
signed:{by,at,name}          // name = the signed-in person's name (older entries may lack it)
```
The page writes these with nested `update`s such as `{temps:{u1:{am:{v:3.2,by,at}}}}`, which must merge deeply (see `runtime-api.md`).

**`weeks/<Monday YYYY-MM-DD>`**: `week, items:{<checkId>:bool}, by, at, notes:{text,by,at}, signed:{by,at,name}`

**`extras/<id>`**, **`cleaning/<id>`**: `name, how, freq ("after use"|"daily"|"weekly"|"fortnightly"|"monthly"|"quarterly"|"yearly"), who, createdAt, lastAt?, lastBy?, lastSet?, log:[{at,by,note,set?}] (newest first, max 30), importedAt?, importedFrom?`

`lastSet: true` (and `set: true` on its log entry) means the last-done date was entered by hand ("Last done on" → Save date) rather than ticked off at the time: `lastAt` is then midday on that date (or the moment it was saved, if it was today) and the page shows it as a date only. `lastBy` is whoever entered it. Ticking the task done sets `lastSet: false`.

**`deliveries/<id>`**: `date (YYYY-MM-DD), at, supplier, supplierId (suppliers/<id> at that site, or null if typed), items, chilled (°C or null), frozen (°C or null), noTemp, packaging ("ok"|"no"), order ("ok"|"no"), outcome ("accepted"|"rejected"), note, by`. Chilled passes at 8°C or below (5°C ideal), frozen at −15°C or below (−18°C ideal). A rejection, or accepting despite a failed check, needs a `note`. Staff can write.

**`maintenance/<id>`**: `title, area, details, priority ("urgent"|"soon"|"later"), status ("open"|"done"), reportedBy, reportedAt, at, doneBy?, doneAt?, fixNote?, log:[{at,by,what:"Done"|"Reopened",note}]` (newest first, max 30). Staff can write. Maintenance → All sites reads every site's collection.

**`proveit/<id>`**: `date, method, food, reading, unit, pass, action, by, at`

**`allergens/<id>`**: `name, source, contains:[allergen names], notes, by, at, importedFrom?`

**`allergenDocs/<id>`**: `title, note, fileName, assetId, size, by, at`. `assetId` is the PDF's key in the KV namespace (`FILES`), served at `/_blob/<assetId>`.

**`suppliers/<id>`**: `name, supplies, contact, phone, email, address, rating, notes, by, at`

**`contacts/<id>`**: `type, name, person, phone, outOfHours, email, account, notes, by, at`

**Saved to several sites.** Documents in `extras`, `cleaning`, `plans`, `suppliers`, `contacts`, `onboarding`, `allergens` and `allergenDocs` may also carry `linkId` (the same on every copy) and `sites:[siteIds]` (where it was last sent). Saving with sites ticked writes a copy at each one: the copy with the same `linkId` is replaced (for `extras` and `cleaning` only the item's own fields are updated, so each site keeps its own `lastAt`, `lastBy` and `log`); otherwise a new one is added. Suppliers, contacts, allergen items and tasks saved before linking are matched by name; HACCP & risk, onboarding documents and allergen PDFs only by `linkId`. Removing deletes the copy at the current site only. Allergen PDF copies share one `assetId`; the stored file is deleted once no site's `allergenDocs` refers to it.

**`staff/<id>`**: `name, role, start, topics:{<topic>:{date,by}}, notes, personId, sites:[siteIds], at`

Training topics (`<topic>`): `hygiene`, `cross`, `cleaning`, `chilling`, `cooking`, `allergens`, `diary`, `l2`. A site's `trainingOff` (set from Staff training → Topics for this site) lists the topics it doesn't use: they're hidden there and not counted as training to do, and any dates already in `topics` are kept.

**`reviews/<YYYY-MM-DD>`**: `date, answers:{<q>:{a:"Yes"|"No", d}}, notes, by, at`

**`plans/<id>`** (HACCP plans and risk assessments): `type:"haccp"|"risk", title, …metadata, steps[] or rows[], notes, source, createdBy, createdAt, updatedBy, updatedAt, history[]`

**`onboarding/<id>`**: `category, title, audience, owner, date, reviewDate, summary, sections:[{heading,body}], notes, source, created…/updated…, history[]`

**`inspections/<id>`** (EHO): `inspectionDate, inspector, authority, visitType, rating, scores:{hygiene,structure,management}, revisitDate, summary, goodPoints[], issues:[{id,issue,area,priority,action,deadline,ref,done,doneBy,doneAt,fixNote}], notes, source, created…/updated…, history[]`

**`config/shared`**: the last published shared setup: `opening, closing, weekly, from, to[], by, at`.

**`config/people`**: `{ "u_…": "<name>" }`, names for the `u_…` ids on older records. Read-only.
